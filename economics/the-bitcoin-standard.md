# Chapter 1: Money

Barter has existed for thousands of years, but it is highly impractical.
The larger the market, the more specialization and exchanging of goods there is.
The main problem with barter in larger markets is the problem of **coincidence of wants**---what you want to acquire is produced by someone who doesn't want to buy what you are selling.
There are three distinct aspects to this problem:

* What you want may is not necessarily equal in value to what you have and diving the product into smaller parts may be impractical or even impossible.
* What you want to acquire may be more durable and valuable, while what you are selling may be perishable. For example, imagine trying to collect enough berries to buy a yacht.
* Most products cannot be easily moved.

The three aspects can be summarized as relating to scale, time, and space.

A solution to this problem is **indirect exchange**---finding some other good that can be exchanged for what you want to sell.
That intermediary good is called a **medium of exchange**.
Although any good could serve that role, more efficient solutions will naturally emerge: single medium of exchange that everyone uses.
A good that assumes a role of widely accepted medium of exchange is called **money**.

Money is different from an investment because

* investment offers a return, while money does not
* money is supposed to carry much less risk
* money is much more liquid

Carl Menger claimed that the key property of a good that leads to it being adopted as money is **salability**---the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with the least loss in its price.
Salability across scales means a good can be easily split into smaller parts or bundled together into larger ones.
Salability across space refers to ease of moving the good.
Salability across time refers to good's ability to hold value into the future enabling **store of value**.

The last aspect is the most difficult to fulfill.
The good should not deteriorate over time.
The supply of the good should not increase drastically, so that its value doesn't drop.

Money whose supply is hard to increase is called **hard money**, while the opposite is called **easy money**.
Hardness of money can be understood through the **stock** and the **flow**.
The stock consists of everything that has been produced in the past minus everything that has been consumed or destroyed.
The flow is the additional production that will be produced in the next time period.
The ratio of the stock to the flow is a reliable indicator of a good's hardness.

If one stores value in easy money, that good's supply could be increased and the wealth of the individual would be destroyed.
Thus, for something to assume monetary role, it has to be costly to produce.
Technological or political developments may increase supply of a monetary good leading to it being replaced by other media of exchange.

Another important aspect to salability is medium's acceptance by others.
The more people use a monetary good, the more liquid it is, making it easier to exchange it without loss.
When it comes to computing protocols, for example, a few dominant tends to emerge.
IMAP, POP3, and SMTP have many flaws but they have become what is being used for emails.

Another consequence of having wide acceptance of a medium of exchange is the ability to express all prices in terms of it.
This function is referred to as **unit of account**.
This allows to measure the value that producers create and how much do consumers have to pay for the goods.
With easy money whose quantity can easily change, it is difficult to accurately reflect the opportunity costs associated with the goods.

# Chapter 3: Monetary Metals

Gold has very high annual stock-to-flow ratio (about 70).
Silver's ratio, on the other hand, is only around 5: silver is easier to refine and is also consumed in industrial processes, unlike gold.
This makes it possible for silver bubbles to exist.

Britain was the first to adopt the gold standard (under the direction of Isaac Newton).
With the development of telegraph and railways in the 19th century, it made even more sense to use bills and checks, and back them using gold, while abandoning silver.
Most nations followed Britain, with Hong Kong and China being the last ones in the 1930s.
Ammous hypothesizes that it took China and India (which adopted gold standard only in the late 19th century) so long to catch up to the West in the 20th century only because they were so late to the party.

Despite gold standard's success, gold is cumbersome to store which meant that its reserves had to be centralized.
This, according to Ammous, lead to the following flaws:

* Governments and banks were always creating media of exchange beyond the quantity of gold in their reserves.
* Many countries held not only gold, but also other currencies in their reserves.

# Chapter 4: Government Money

Government money, or **fiat money**, has two important properties:

* One cannot redeem fiat money in gold.
* All fiat money could *originally* be redeemed in gold or silver. Government currencies are, to some extent, still backed by gold or other countries' currencies (which are themselves backed by gold).

At the start of WW1, many European countries went off the gold standard, i.e.\ suspended gold convertability.
During the war, the currencies of the major powers depreciated from 6.6\% in the UK to as much as 69\% in Austria.
Therefore, after the war, the governments faced a dilemma: getting back to gold standard with a fair valuation of the currency would have enraged the citizens, while using old exchange rates would have encouraged citizens to sell gold outside the country where it is valued fairly. 
Unsurprisingly, the major powers did not go back to the gold standard.
