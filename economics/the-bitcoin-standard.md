# Chapter 1: Money

Barter has existed for thousands of years, but it is highly impractical.
The larger the market, the more specialization and exchanging of goods there is.
The main problem with barter in larger markets is the problem of **coincidence of wants**---what you want to acquire is produced by someone who doesn't want to buy what you are selling.
There are three distinct aspects to this problem:

* What you want may is not necessarily equal in value to what you have and diving the product into smaller parts may be impractical or even impossible.
* What you want to acquire may be more durable and valuable, while what you are selling may be perishable. For example, imagine trying to collect enough berries to buy a yacht.
* Most products cannot be easily moved.

The three aspects can be summarized as relating to scale, time, and space.

A solution to this problem is **indirect exchange**---finding some other good that can be exchanged for what you want to sell.
That intermediary good is called a **medium of exchange**.
Although any good could serve that role, more efficient solutions will naturally emerge: single medium of exchange that everyone uses.
A good that assumes a role of widely accepted medium of exchange is called **money**.

Money is different from an investment because

* investment offers a return, while money does not
* money is supposed to carry much less risk
* money is much more liquid

Carl Menger claimed that the key property of a good that leads to it being adopted as money is **salability**---the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with the least loss in its price.
Salability across scales means a good can be easily split into smaller parts or bundled together into larger ones.
Salability across space refers to ease of moving the good.
Salability across time refers to good's ability to hold value into the future enabling **store of value**.

The last aspect is the most difficult to fulfill.
The good should not deteriorate over time.
The supply of the good should not increase drastically, so that its value doesn't drop.

Money whose supply is hard to increase is called **hard money**, while the opposite is called **easy money**.
Hardness of money can be understood through the **stock** and the **flow**.
The stock consists of everything that has been produced in the past minus everything that has been consumed or destroyed.
The flow is the additional production that will be produced in the next time period.
The ratio of the stock to the flow is a reliable indicator of a good's hardness.

If one stores value in easy money, that good's supply could be increased and the wealth of the individual would be destroyed.
Thus, for something to assume monetary role, it has to be costly to produce.
Technological or political developments may increase supply of a monetary good leading to it being replaced by other media of exchange.

Another important aspect to salability is medium's acceptance by others.
The more people use a monetary good, the more liquid it is, making it easier to exchange it without loss.
When it comes to computing protocols, for example, a few dominant tends to emerge.
IMAP, POP3, and SMTP have many flaws but they have become what is being used for emails.
