Group $G$ is a set with an operation $*$ which

* is closed, i.e.\ $\forall a, b \in G\colon a * b \in G$
* has an identity $i$, i.e.\ $\forall a \in G\colon i*a = a*i = a$
* is associative, i.e. $\forall a, b, c \in G\colon a * (b * c)  = (a * b) * c$
* every element $a$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$, i.e.\ $\forall a \in G\colon a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e$
